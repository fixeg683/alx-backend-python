## üè° Airbnb Clone Backend ‚Äî Task 0

### **Documenting Project Features and Functionalities**

---

### üìò **Overview**

This task focuses on **identifying and documenting** the core features and functionalities required for the **Airbnb Clone Backend**. The goal is to clearly define what the backend system must support to ensure smooth operation of an online accommodation booking platform ‚Äî similar to Airbnb.

This documentation serves as the foundation for backend design, database modeling, and subsequent API development.

### üß© **Objective**

To create a **comprehensive system feature specification** covering all key modules, including:

* User management
* Property management
* Booking system
* Payment processing
* Reviews and ratings

This task ensures that all developers, designers, and testers understand how each part of the system interacts and functions.
